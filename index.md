## Overview

This course introduces algorithms, statistical methods and data analysis programming 
routines relevant for genome biology. It consists of three main components:
lectures, hands-on practicals and student course projects. The lecture topics cover databases, sequence 
(NGS) analysis, phylogenetics, comparative genomics, genome-wide profiling methods, 
network biology and more. The hands-on practicals include homework assignments and 
course projects focusing on data analysis programming of next generation genome data 
using command-line tools on a computer cluster and the programming environment R. 

## Who should take this class?

Students with a strong interest and motivation in acquiring the skills required for mastering
the computational aspects of modern genome research. The class is mainly
targeting graduate students but senior undergraduate students are welcome to
enroll as well. The main audience of this class are usually students from
bioscience, biomedical and bioengineering programs as well as CS and statistics
students with interest in computational biology.

## Can I audit this class?

It is possible to audit this class. However, due to the emphasis on active participation
in practicals and course projects, students usually learn much more if they enroll into the
class rather than auditing it in a passive manner.
